## git challenge

In this repository you can see a branch named `feature/git`.
If you look at the commits, it's a total mess.

1. There are too many commits with non-descriptive messages
2. Would you be able to tidy it up? For example, make a couple of commits
   with good commit messages out of those.
3. Specifically, it would be nice to have 2 commits instead of 4.

Yes, it can be done by reordering the commits with 'git rebase' command. 
Use 'fixup' to melt commits 'update2' and 'test2' into 'update1' and 'test1' accordingly. 
The branch 'feature/git' now shows one commit for each mega_fucntion_#.txt file.
